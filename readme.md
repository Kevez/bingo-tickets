# Bingo Tickets

## About
A set of bingo tickets that I had to create as part of a technical test.

## Tech stack
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- HTML5
- CSS
- Express

## Clone repo

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Kevez/bingo-tickets.git
```

You can now open index.html to load the tickets. 
To run tests make sure Node is installed and install app's dependencies.

## Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

Once done open /tests/SpecRunner.html to run the tests.
